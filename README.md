Titanic Survival Prediction Analysis
This project explores the Titanic dataset to analyze the factors influencing passenger survival rates. The analysis is performed using Python, with various visualizations and statistical insights to uncover patterns related to survival based on passenger attributes such as age, fare, class, and gender.

🚢 Project Overview:
The Titanic dataset provides information about passengers, including their survival status, class, age, fare, and more. The goal is to identify trends and relationships in the data that contributed to the passengers' likelihood of survival.

Key Findings:
Age: Most passengers were between 20–40 years old. Survivors were generally younger.

Fare: Most passengers paid less than $100. Higher fares were correlated with higher survival rates, typically in first class.

Survival vs Age: Younger passengers were more likely to survive, especially children.

Fare vs Pclass: Higher fare correlated with a higher passenger class (1st > 2nd > 3rd), which influenced survival.

Gender & Survival: Women and children had higher survival rates due to the "women and children first" protocol.

📊 Tools & Technologies:
Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook: For data analysis and visualization

🔍 Visualizations:
Histograms: Age and Fare distribution

Boxplots: Age vs Survival, Fare vs Pclass

Scatterplots: Age vs Fare, colored by Survival status

Conclusion:
This analysis demonstrates that factors like age, fare, and class had a significant impact on survival rates. The insights gained from this analysis can be used to develop a machine learning model for predicting survival on the Titanic based on these features.
